    <h2>Text Version</h2>
        This chart is based on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JClp-tDfhuf6BGlO_wZxrbwnvWgdHkKwCjmsxkJMfFU">Ironman PvM Exploration Guide</a>.
            The document contains routing for bosses that don't necessarily have gear unlocks, alongside more thorough explanations for overall progression and specific steps.
            It also currently houses the FAQ, as most questions aren't frequent enough to put them on this website.
